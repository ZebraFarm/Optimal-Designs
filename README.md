# Convex Optimal Designs

This following repository contains a collection of implemented algorithms that utilize the CVX package for convex optimization. These optimization methods are then applied to a variety of (D- ,A-, C-, I- ) Optimal Designs.

The problem set is set out to build and explore how CVX works to solve designs in both Python and R.

Once getting a sense of the powers of each languages implementation of this package, a package has been built with R, to easily work with a variety of designs.

The limitations of the CVX package included its lack of ability to be used in parrallel computing. Further work is being done to build out these packages with other students under the supervision of Julie Zhou (University of Victoria, Department of Mathematics & Statistics). This here is the initial ground work necessary for a fully functioning Optimal Design package.
